Interactive learning -> Check how it works
Ucertaintly sampling -> Check how it works, but we have too much noise and too little data, so doesnt make sense
IUI papers: deadline paper submission september/august. Intelligent User Interfaces -> http://iui.acm.org/2019/call_for_papers.html

Add to seed terms, sxtract new sentences, THEN run term_sentence_expansion to improve expansion...

Use Human annotated sentences more smartply

Focus more on the Coner viewer value:
Current solutions: 
1. https://prodi.gy/ -> Prodigy only show sentence, extracted entity and than rate yes or no. From makers of spacy.io
2. https://spacy.io/
Coner brings all extracted entities into context of the whole paper, easy to interact, easy to rate for multiple facets AND can select new entities

So instead of focusing thesis RQ just on improving expansion and filtering of Coner, also focus on the IUI of Coner, how it can improve
human entity feedback now and in future work, where you only highlight entities that have a big impact to get feedback on.

1 of the focuses: Smart selection of entities, to make the human feedback more scalable, so make every human rating more valuable.

So for TSE-NER 2 things:
1. Fix current expansion improvement approach: add relevant entities to seeds, then extract training sentences, then run term expansion etc and see difference!
2. Use sentences with relevant or irrelevant entities with feedback from Viewer:
    - Take sentence, and label entities in these sentences
    - Find similar sentences for relevant: than entities in these sentences also positively labeled
    - Find similar sentences for irrelevant: Then entities negative.
    - READ TSE-NER PAPER!!
    - Just grab all sentences from the ES index with coner entities in them!!
    - CHECK: How many coner entities ALREADY in seed set?

Describe these approaches in evaluation how TSE-NER and Coner work together.


Ask christoph: how much help can I ask for.
